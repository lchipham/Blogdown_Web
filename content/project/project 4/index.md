Through exploration of Tweets from the general public and prominent news articles (WSJ, Financial Times, NY Times. etc), this project aims to gain insights on market sentiments during the current high inflationary period in the US. "Sentiments" are shaped and defined from discovery of term/word frequency, most mentioned keywords/hashtags, word networks, sentiment analysis and topic modeling. Correlations between US treasury yields data and usage frequency of keywords like "inflation" and "recession" are also found and validated.
