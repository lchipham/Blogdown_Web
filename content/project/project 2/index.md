This web app functions like a calculator, taking new customers' info (variables/parameters of final Machine Learning model: DEBTINC, DELINQ, DEROG, CLAGE, LOAN, NINQ, CLNO) as input and outputting said customer's mortgage default probability.

Based on the quantile in which this probability is, as well as the (adjustable) loan acceptance rate of the bank, the app ultimately outputs the bank's decision on whether to lend to this new customer. If the customer's default probability falls in a higher percentile than the acceptance rate, they are not qualified for loan. On the other hand, if the default probability lies in the acceptable range, the customer is qualified for loan.
